# 598Convex-Optimization-in-Control project

### This is a very naive implementation that author played in the graduate school.
### The goal is to minimize the cost of stablizing the double integrator (2DOF) under the constraints. 
### To implement the mpc.m file, you need to install a free MATLAB package MPT3(https://www.mpt3.org) in advance. This is a very powerful package used for MPC. 
### You can see the report (pdf file) for my conclusion.
